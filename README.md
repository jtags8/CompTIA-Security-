# How I Passed the CompTIA-Security+ without an IT background

On Decembr 5, 2022, I passed the Security+ exam with a score of 789!

Background: I’m a pharmacist who works full-time who wants to make a career change into cybersecurity. My interests are in blue team environments, such as vulnerability analysis, forensics, incident response, and SOC. I am also interested in cloud security. I built and upgraded my own personal computer for PC gaming, otherwise I have no professional IT experience and I don’t have A+ or Net+. I have intermediate knowledge of Python.

Studying: I studied for about 2 months. I got some direction from some friends and from people on Reddit and some discords channels. I started off with watching Professor Messer videos, then watched Andrew Ramdayal's lab videos on Udemy and read the Darril Gibson GCGA book. I took practice exams from Dion, Messer, Ramdayal, and GCGA. I also downloaded the CompTIA Security+ Exam Prep developed by Thanh Hung to quiz myself periodically on the go. I also regularly use TryHackMe and LetsDefend and the CTFs and simulation modules were very helpful in understanding cybersecurity.

Exam: I felt that the exam was tricky. Most of the questions I could answer from the materials, but there were a few questions that I had no idea about. Chances are those questions were experimental. Many 50/50s where I felt both answers could be right, but I remembered to always pick the best answer based on context of the question. Like a lot of people suggested, I saved the PBQs for last, as was suggested by many of my peers.

My main tip for anyone taking the exam is to know EVERYTHING from the objectives and to use more than one study material source. It wasn’t easy, especially when trying to balance studying while working full time with a wife and 5 month old at home, but with everyone’s support nothing’s impossible.

Next up: Network+, AZ-900, build/virtualize a home lab, and wait until a job opens up at my health system. Also waiting for the new CySA!
